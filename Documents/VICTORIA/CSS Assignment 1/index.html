          Hi. My name is Victoria Agbo. Being on this journey towards becoming a
          Sofware Engineer with Stutern is one of the best things that happen to
          me this year, Period. Combining aspects of engineering by using
          battle-tested best-practices, approaches, and frameworks with the
          beauty of art by creating something unique. Add in the ever-evolving
          toolbox and endless opportunities to learn new things and… well…I
          cannot imagine doing anything else.

          So far, I have learnt about CSS types and methods, the different CSS
          selectors, the box model, etc. CSS makes the front-end of a website
          shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites
          would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate.
          In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color
          and more.

          Padding is the spcae between the element content and the element
          border. Margin is used to define the space around elements, while
          Border is used to specify the colour, style and size of the border of
          an element.
